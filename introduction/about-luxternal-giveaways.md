# About Luxternal Giveaways

## What Are Our Luxternal Tokens?

A luxternal token is an [NFT\(What Is An NF](faq.md#what-is-an-nft)[?\)](faq.md#what-is-an-nft) that offers holders the 'crown' status, where they will have exclusive members-only advantages. Because this is all new to everyone, we've devised a step-by-step procedure to help you purchase our token. [\(Click Here To Access\)](../buy-a-luxternal-token/step-by-step-process.md)

The first holders of each token released are assured a seat in our large-scale targeted Influencer Giveaways on **Instagram**. We enter into a contractual agreement with the influencers and agree on a Giveaway campaign, with each campaign being tailored to the influencer's target market.

The quantity of Giveaways is the fuel that allows the community to activate checkpoints on the Luxternal roadmap. After completing a Giveaway campaign, that token will be one step closer to gaining access to the next target on our roadmap. Our roadmap incentives are unlocked based on the number of giveaway campaigns completed. \(To see the current Year 1 rewards, [please read our roadmap](../roadmap-activations/240-tokens.md).\)

Tokens can be resold on the secondary market [\(How to resell?\)](../resell-a-luxternal-token/step-by-step-process.md), and the roadmap incentives will be transferred to the new owner. **However, the Giveaway growth campaign is not transferable; the growth campaign will only offer access to the token's first holders.**

## Why Us?

### We Use Clean NFTs

Luxternal has selected the [energy-efficient Tezos blockchain](https://medium.com/tqtezos/clean-nfts-on-tezos-58566b2fdba1), on which we will mint and sell NFTs through the [Hic Et Nunc marketplace](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/luxternalgiveaways). Tezos is an open-source blockchain for assets and apps that are constantly growing and developing through effective on-chain governance.

Our tokens on the Tezos network operate on a 'Delegated Proof of Stake' network. Tezos' pioneering Proof of Stake technology employs two million times less energy than Proof of Work networks like Ethereum to protect its network.

Sustainability through innovation is critical for Tezos and Luxternal. The use of clean NFTs and energy-efficient networks assures that the impact of this new medium for sharing creative expression is not diminished by excessive energy use.

### Real-Value Roadmap Activations 

Luxternal is in it through the long haul with Roadmap Activations. Token's unique properties will have unique awards in the future.
